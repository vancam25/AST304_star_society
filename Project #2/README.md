1. `astro_const.py`: module containing physical constants, uses `astropy`
2. `eos.py`: starter code for the equation of state
3. `test_eos.py`: unit test for the equation of state; do not modify this file
4. `eos_table.txt`: comparison data for the equation of state, used by `test_eos.py`
5. `structure.py`: starter code to integrate stellar structure equations
6. `observations.py`: module containing class for reading and storing tabulated 
    white dwarf masses, radii, and associated uncertainties.
7. `Joyce.txt`: Table 4, Joyce et al. (2018). Data for `observations.py`.
