Project Breakup:

Implement & Test EOS ("eos.py", "test_eos.py") -> Steven

Implement Structure Equations for EOS ("structure.py") -> 

Setting Central Boundary Conditions ("structure.py") -> 

Construct the Integration Loop ("structure.py") -> 
  Test Integration -> 

Make Mass-Radius Table -> Steven

Compare to Observations -> Sans

Final WriteUp -> Steven + someone else if its longer (but it dosen't look like it should be long)
