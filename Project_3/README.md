### Project Three: Radius and Luminosity of Low Mass Stars

===========

In this project, we calculate radius and luminosity values for low mass stars, as well as experimenting with the p+p reaction rate. Changing this rate has an impact on the structure of the star, which in change influences the luminosity. In order to explore these tasks, we were able to take the code from Project 2 on white dwarfs and add in needed equations for luminosity and reaction rate. From this, we were able to generate the needed values and plots to answer the questions set out for us.

Report/closeout
---------------
1. You can find our write up in `Project3_WriteUp.md`. 
2. How to run our code: 

        Run `main_code_run.py` to get the run for parts 2.10, 2.11, and should also be for part 3. Folder `FinalPlots` holds the graph outputs and also the comparisons for part 3.
