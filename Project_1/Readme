# Project 1: Kepler's Problem 
The contents of this project and it's files are to model Kepler's Problem, using ODEs and solvers to model two orbiting point particles.
We use methods such as Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta (2nd and 4th order) in order to integrate the orbits of the particles. 
We then investigate the system by calculating and analyzing it's energies and orbits via graphical analysis.
Below is a description of the files and scripts used, and produced, by our analysis:

There are two files that are doing the calculation: 'ode.py' and 'updated_kepler.py'. 
'ode.py' is a script file that defines and stores integration methods to solve the orbits of the two point particles. 
'updated_kepler.py' is a script file that uses 'ode.py' and it's functions to calculate the energies, the derivatives, 
integrate the orbit with initial conditions, and finally set the initial conditions.
'orbital_calc_plot_error.py' is a file that runs the two previous scripts and computes graphical analysis of the two particle system. 
Additionally, we have a folder of plots (.pdf; the results of our graphical analysis) and the write-up document (.docx) that answers the questions
put forth by the professor for us to answer. 


To run our code, you'll need to import libraries such as numpy and math. Make sure a version of python 3.6 is installed.

Run orbital_calc_plot_error.py to produce error analysis graphs, and orbital graphs. 

Again, to run 'orbital_calc_plot_error.py' insure a version of python 3.6 is installed.
Download 'orbital_calc_plot_error.py', 'ode.py', 'updated_kepler.py' in the same directory. 

!! update 'save_plot_directory' on line 14 in orbital_calc_plot_error.py to a relavent directory on your machine !!

Run 'orbital_calc_plot_error.py' in a python terminal.
